# HandBrake [![Windows Build](https://github.com/K4sum1/StickShift/workflows/Windows%20Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/K4sum1/StickShift/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Windows+Build%22)


StickShift is a fork of the HandBrake open-source video transcoder for Windows 7, licensed under the [GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2](LICENSE).

StickShift takes videos you already have and makes new ones that work on your mobile phone, tablet, TV media player, game console, computer, or web browserâ€”nearly anything that supports modern video formats.

StickShift works with most common video files and formats, including ones created by consumer and professional video cameras, mobile devices such as phones and tablets, game and computer screen recordings, and DVD and Blu-ray discs. StickShift leverages tools such as FFmpeg, x264, and x265 to create new MP4 or MKV video files from these *Sources*.

For information on downloading, building/installing, and using StickShift, see the official [HandBrake Documentation](https://handbrake.fr/docs) for now.
